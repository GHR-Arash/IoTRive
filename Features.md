GPS tracking: Track the location of your vehicles in real-time on a map, see their routes, and get historical data for analysis. This is the foundation of any telematics platform and enables many other features.

Vehicle diagnostics: Monitor engine health, fuel levels, tire pressure, and other critical vehicle data in real-time. This helps identify potential issues early on and prevent costly breakdowns.

Geofencing: Set virtual boundaries around specific areas and receive alerts when vehicles enter or leave them. This is useful for managing fleet operations, preventing unauthorized use, and ensuring safety.

Fuel management: Track fuel consumption, identify areas for improvement, and optimize fuel efficiency. This can lead to significant cost savings for businesses with large fleets.

Reporting and analytics: Generate reports on various aspects of vehicle performance, such as mileage, fuel consumption, and driver behavior. This data can be used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and make better business decisions.

Advanced Features
Driver behavior monitoring: Monitor driver behavior, such as speeding, harsh braking, and idling, to identify areas for coaching and improve overall safety.

Remote diagnostics and troubleshooting: Technicians can remotely diagnose vehicle problems and provide guidance to drivers, reducing downtime and repair costs.

Predictive maintenance: Analyze vehicle data to predict potential maintenance issues and schedule preventative maintenance, reducing downtime and extending vehicle life.

Video telematics: Integrate dashcams or other video cameras into the platform for real-time visibility into driver behavior and accident investigation.

Open API and integrations: Allow the platform to integrate with other business systems, such as ERP, accounting, and dispatch software, for a more holistic view of operations.

Additional Features:
